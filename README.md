## Motivation

This is the final project in this course and it includes many stuff I have learned throughout the course.

1.  Database with  **postgres**  and  **sqlalchemy**  (`models.py`)
2.  API  with  **Flask**  (`app.py`)
3.  TDD  **Unittest**  (`test_app.py`)
4.  Authorization &  Authentification **Auth0**  (`auth.py`)
5.  Deployment on  `Heroku`

## Project Setup

Make sure you  `cd`  into the correct folder (with all app files) before following the setup steps. Also, you need the latest version of  [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  and  [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)  installed on your machine.
